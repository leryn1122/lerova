It supports 4 shells currently. No more shells are about to be available in the
future, since following shells cover most terminal users.

  - `bash`
  - `fish`
  - `zsh`
  - `powershell`

To enable the auto completion requires to install the third party
`bash-completion` manually.

  ```bash
  # Ubuntu
  sudo apt-get install bash-completion
  source /etc/bash_completion

  # Mac OS (if using `brew` as package manager)
  brew install bash-completion
  source $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion
  ```

Output the bash completion contents and source it as below. It is trivial.

  ```bash
  ## Using bash
  $ source <(vsp completion bash)

  ## Using zsh
  $ source <(vsp completion zsh)

  ## Using fish
  $ vsp completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/vsp.fish
  ```

Additionally, you may want to add the completion source in your `.bashrc` for
every session.

On Windows platform, it is recommended to use powershell as below:

  ```powershell
  PS> vsp completion powershell > $HOME\.vsp-completion.ps1
  PS> Add-Content $PROFILE '. $HOME\.vsp-completion.ps1'
  PS> Add-Content $PROFILE 'if (Get-Command vsp -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) {
          vsp completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
      }'
  ```
